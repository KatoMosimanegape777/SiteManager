1.	Botswana Logo should appear first in the login. Logins should be integrated to with AD
2.	some sites have multiple subnets we should include associated subnets. e.g hospital serowe.
3.	no deletion but achieve the site so there is a history to look back if the site is no longer active.
4.	regular users should be able to make notes on the sites if there if more info relevant to that site.
5.	the site manager should be interlinked with nageos if sites get renamed it should update both in nageos.


on the Sites in the database add these values: { show: false, Edit: "" }
	{ show: false } this will allow us to hide & unhide the site instead of deleting and we can log who did 
			       the modification in the e.g  { edit: "kago@mail.com achieved this site " } key.

on the Sites the database add these value: { notes: "site was changed from vsat to fibre"}
	this is to give context on future investigation on what may have happened to the site.
	on the website to write a note just double click on the site row and click on button written 
	edit then a text box gets enabled the the user can write a note then save.
